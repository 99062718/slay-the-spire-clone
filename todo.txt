item system:
- add more items to common / uncommon
- allow for more types of cards like lifesteal, reshuffle deck, find card in deck, ect
- add and remove items when used
- make hands draws randomised instead of set
room system:
- every room the player gets the choice between multiple what room theyre moving to next
- these doors to the next rooms all have a preview of what is to come (the theme of the room, shop or not, guarenteed item, ect)
- every room has a theme and each theme has its own set of enemies
inventory system:
- players can hold a certain amount of cards in their deck (usable cards during battle)
- cards gained will be moved to a bag when chosen to not be used in deck
- cards can be sold to be used to buy things in the shop
difficulty system:
- buff and debuff system the player can choose to make the game easier or harder for themselves
- some of those could be unlocked by doing certain things during runs
- difficulty scales with rooms scaled
- some room themes will be harder on average than the other
story/endless mode:
- players can choose between playing the story mode (which has an ending and a final boss) or the endless mode (which i dont think i need to explain)
player:
- cards could be upgraded?
- players with different playstyles?
stats:
- add defense and attack multiplier for scaling and different enemies
- add ability to draw more or less than 3 cards on turn
cool tech stuff i want to try:
- reading format in hexbytes for entity and card data(and try to encrypt it)
- language options?
